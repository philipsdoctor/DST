# DST

A Dead Simple Template language... it will either add or subtract an hour from your dev time!

## Usage

Leiningen 

    [org.clojars.pdoctor/dst "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

Sample Code

    (ns example.core
      (:require [dst.core :refer [generate-template]]))

    (defn foo 
      []  
      (let [my-template (generate-template "Hello ${name}")]
        (prn (my-template {:name "Phil"}))))

Syntax

The generate-template function expects a string template.  The template contains text with interspersed symbol names.  A symbol is understood as text in the template surrounded by ${}.  generate-template will return a function that expects a dict with a keyword for every symbol passed in the template.

A simple example (generate-template "Hello ${name}") will return a function similar to the following but with validation:

    (fn [{name :name}] (str "Hello " name))

The ' character can be used as an escape, example (generate-template "Hello '${name}") will generate a function that takes an empty map and returns "Hello ${name}".
